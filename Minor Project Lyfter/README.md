Our group did the Lyfter project. THe project prompt is as follows:

Lyfter is an app-based personal vehicle system (i.e., ride-hailing), and they approach your team for help in designing a system that allows them to efficiently match riders to drivers. They want your team to help them claim “the wait time is never more than 5 minutes”, and thus in determining how many drivers they should recruit if they anticipate 100 riders at any instant of time.  

All of our code and test cases are contained within this repository. 

To use the system, the main class is the only one that needs to be run. Once the main class is run, there will be a prompt as to whether the user wants a carpool or a private ride.
For testing purposes, there is also a prompt requesting one of the .txt files with preloaded locations of riders.
