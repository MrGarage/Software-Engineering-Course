This project was a custom project, approved by Professor Jha, is designed to help out the Rutgers Food Pantry with keeping track of their inventory and people who come and go. 
This was done by using forms with user input to update different databases, all locally hosted, which stores all of the information and the inventory of the food pantry. 

# Videos of the Databases

The videos of the locally hosted databases can be viewed at the following link.

**As the databases are locally hosted, the videos show how the databases are updated, the forms work, and the code itself works. The code can be seen in the files as well.**
